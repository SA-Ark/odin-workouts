    <h1>Chinups</h1>
    <img src= "../../images/chinups.svg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Never let the tension leave your back. Your arms should
        straighten fully, but don't just hang. Maintain 
        constant tension across your shoulder girdles--the 
        muscles around your shoulder blades and collarbone. 
        The "dead hang" position--letting your shoulders shrug
        up to your ears--places strain on your biceps tendons
        and rotator cuffs.</p>
    <p>Pay attention to your shoulder blades. Once you start pulling up, 
        don't use your arms alone. Instead, think about pulling 
        your shoulder blades down and back as your elbows travel 
        toward your ribs. You're controlling your shoulders and 
        shoulder blades using what physiologists call
        "scapulo-humeral rhythm,</p>
    <p>Work to finish the rep. When your chin clears the top 
        of the bar, don't stop pulling. Squeeze your shoulder
        blades back and try to make and hold a double chin.
        Think about continuing to pull upwards, even if you're 
        not getting any higher. As you're doing this, try to 
        maintain tension in your abs and glutes. Your torso 
        might lean slightly backward so your hips and feet 
        are in front of the bar. That's not a problem, but 
        you shouldn't let your shoulders jut forward of the bar,
        Cressey says. That could set you up for a rotator cuff 
        injury.</p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Exhale while pulling yourself up so your chin
            is level with the bar. Pause at the top.</li>
            <li>Lower yourself (inhaling as you go down)
            until your elbows are straight.</li>
            <li>Repeat the movement without touching the floor.</li>
            <li>Complete the number of repetitions your workout requires.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The entire movement should be slow and controlled. Once your form deteriorates,
            it's time to stop and take a rest or you may risk injury. </li>
            <li>If your grip is too wide you won't be able to have the 
            full range of motion. </li>
            <li>Your elbows are kept close to your body throughout the 
            pullup. Do not let them be flared out. </li>
        </ul>
